## Analyzing bulkRNA-sequencing data in the prefrontal cortex of Akap11 mutant mice
A project seeking to reproduce and evaluate the results found in the study, "Elevated synaptic PKA activity and abnormal striatal dopamine signaling in Akap11 mutant mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder" (Song et al.,doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.24.614783).

### Overview


### Data Acquisition
The raw bulk RNA-seq reads were found on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with the ID number GSE306677 as listed in the publication. The samples' SRA accession numbers were selected from this database for this project.
