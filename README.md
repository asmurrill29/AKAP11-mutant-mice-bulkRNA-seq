## A project in reproducibility: analyzing bulkRNA-sequencing data in the prefrontal cortex of AKAP11 mutant mice
A project seeking to reproduce and evaluate the results found in the study, "Elevated synaptic PKA activity and abnormal striatal dopamine signaling in Akap11 mutant mice, a genetic model of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.24.614783).
